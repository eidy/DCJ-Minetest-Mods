Nuclear Material by Devyn Collier Johnson (DevynCJohnson@Gmail.com)
This mod borrows some code from other mods. Please see the licensing below.


Description:
This mod adds uranium ores to the mapgen. Mining an uranium ore yields one uranium lump. The uranium lump can be used in the furnace (burntime=20), or it can be used to craft various objects. Crafting four uranium lumps produces a uranium block. Uranium blocks and one uranum lump can be used to make a nuclear bomb. The nuclear bomb as an explosion range of thirty voxels in all directions. Uranium blocks and ores have a soft glow. This radiation is easy to spot in dark caves.
