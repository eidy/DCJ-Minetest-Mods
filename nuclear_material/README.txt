Nuclear Material by Devyn Collier Johnson (DevynCJohnson@Gmail.com)
This mod borrows some code from other mods. Please see the licensing below.


Description:
This mod adds radium ores to the mapgen. Mining an radium ore yields one radium lump. The radium lump can be used in the furnace (burntime=20), or it can be used to craft various objects. Crafting four radium lumps produces a radium block. Radium blocks and one uranum lump can be used to make a nuclear bomb. The nuclear bomb as an explosion range of thirty voxels in all directions. Radium blocks and ores have a soft glow. This radiation is easy to spot in dark caves.
